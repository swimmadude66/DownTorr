NOTE: our makefile was not included in our project tar. It has been included
with this assignment. It needs to be added to the project directory before
running through the instructions.



Instructions to test
	1. run 'make' in a terminal
	2. run the compiled program
		a. the program name is DownTorr
		b. the first arguement is a path to a torrent file
		c. the second arguement is a folder to save the file
	
	Example command: ./DownTorr somefile.torrent somefolder/

Grading Compatability
	parse torrent: Works
		Our program can sucessfully parse torrents
	2) hash/handshake: Inbetween
		We have hashing working, we did not get handshakes working
	3) parse message: Inbetween
		We can parse messages, however some still break our parser
	4) request: Does not work
		We do not have code for this
	5) receive blocks: Does not work
		We have structs to manage this when we recieve data, but no code to
		actually do so
	6) combine + verify: Does not work
		We have structs to manage this when we recieve data, but no code to
		actually do so 
 

	Extra Credit
	tracker: We can correctly create a get request for a tracker. Using an
		outside program to send get requests to a tracker returns a peer 
		list. However our program crashes when attempting to setup a 
		connection with the tracker.
